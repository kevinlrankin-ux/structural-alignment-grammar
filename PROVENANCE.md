Statement that SAG is neutral / pre-competitive / non-enforcing

What counts as an “official release”

Optional: checksum policy for PDFs/releases

## Licensing model

SAG is dual-licensed to maximize adoption while preserving attribution and patent safety:

- **CC BY 4.0** applies to specifications, documentation, conceptual material, and examples.
- **Apache License 2.0** applies to schemas, tooling, and code artifacts.

This separation is intentional and reflects SAG’s role as public semantic infrastructure.
